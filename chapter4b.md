### 《挺身而出：预防霸凌、人际矛盾和暴力》教师手册

#### 介绍
 
《挺身而出》课程旨在教授儿童及其家人具体的人际交往技能。本课程致力于以下几点：“儿童及其家人能做什么”，“儿童如何才能安全成长并且感觉受到重视”。

Because bullying is an activity that takes place among children and because stopping bullying is something most successfully accomplished in the community, the most effective way to teach prevention of bullying is in a group situation.  For that reason, the materials are written in a format that is user-friendly for teachers or group leaders.  To assist you in this process, the guides for each age group will walk you through what to say, what responses to expect, what role-plays to use and how to follow up.  Each day provides discussion outlines, role-plays and follow-up activities. It covers all the common - and some not so common - concerns children express, with the accompanying explanations.
霸凌一般常见于儿童群体中，而通过社区在阻止霸凌上往往能取得显著成效，因此在群体场景下教授预防霸凌的知识最行之有效。考虑到这一点，本指导手册所有材料在编写中都做到便于老师或者项目负责人理解和执行。在您项目的执行过程中，此指导手册会按照不同的年龄分组会在四个方面：“言语措辞”、“反馈形式” 、“角色扮演”和“跟进机制”为您提供不同的指导意见。每一天都会有不同的讨论大纲，角色扮演和跟进活动。指导手册包含了儿童所有常见和那些不常见的担忧，并且配套了相应的解释。

This guide, however, is only a tool.  You should feel free to use the materials in a way that is consistent with your own style and comfort level, and the needs of the children you are working with.  For example, you may break the activities down into smaller parts, adapt the role-plays to your community, or change some of the language to make it more appropriate to the developmental level of your children.
但是此指导手册只是您的参考工具。您可以根据您自身风格、方便程度及目标儿童群体需求自由使用知道材料。比如：您可以将活动分成更小的部分，改编角色扮演活动，或者为了更好地适合目标儿童的成长水平对部分语言进行加工。

Children are directly affected by their perception of their own well-being.  If we talk to them in a way that makes them feel fearful or insecure, we heighten their sense of vulnerability.  Understanding this is central.  Children who are frightened have fewer options and less self-confidence to handle life events effectively.  On the other hand, when we talk to children in a way that makes them feel confident, capable and informed, they can actually be more effective in protecting themselves.
儿童对自身的认知直接影响他们本身的情绪。如果我们与他们交流的方式让他们感到恐惧或者不安全，他们会感到更加脆弱。清楚认识到这一点是我们工作的核心。那些受到惊吓的儿童更加缺乏主张，缺乏有效应对生活中突发事件的信心。但是如果我们与他们交流的方式让他们感到自信，有能力和被尊重，他们就能更好地保护自己。

Take A Stand is most effective when the five sessions are presented about once a week.  This allows time for the children to utilize the skills and begin to see changes.  Change over time is the goal.  Revisit the program about once a year.  This allows the children to learn new skills as they mature and keeps the concepts fresh for all age levels every year. 
本项目包含五个部分，一周一次最为有效，因为这样的安排让儿童们有足够时间运用我们教授的技能并可以看到自身的变化。儿童们能够更好地保护自己才是我们的目标。另外，项目需要每年回顾一次，这样可以保证儿童在成长过程中不断学习新技能，并且所有年龄段儿童能熟记这些观点。

Adult Role in Prevention of Bullying
欺凌预防中成人的角色

As soon as children begin to interact with others, we can begin to teach them not to be bullies and not to be bullied.  We can give them words for their feelings, limit and change their behavior, and teach them better ways to express their feelings and wishes.  Children do not learn to solve these kinds of problems and get along by themselves.  We need to teach them.
当儿童开始与他人互动时，我们可以开始告诉他们既要做到不欺凌他人，也要保护自己不被欺凌。我们可以教会他们如何使用正确的词语表达自己的情感，限制和改变他们的行为，教会他们如何更好地表达个人情感和愿望。我们不应该让儿童自己学会解决问题，独自消化情绪，相反我们应该去引导他们。

When preschoolers begin to call people names or use unkind words, intervene immediately and consistently.  By age 6 or 7, children learn the power of exclusion.  We begin to hear things like, "She's not my friend and she can't come to my party." You can respond with, "You don't have to be friends with her today, but it's not all right to make her feel bad by telling her she can't come to your party."
如果发现学前年龄的儿童开始直呼别人的名字或者使用一些不友善的词语时，我们应当立即加于干预直到他们改变这一行为。儿童6岁或7岁时，他们就知道排斥他人。我们开始听到一些排斥性话语，比如：“她不是我朋友，她不可以参加我的派对。”这种情况下，您可以这样回应：“你不需要现在和她成为朋友，但是你直接说她不能来参加你的派对会让对方难过的，你这样做是不对的。”

In the early school years, cliques and little groups develop which can be quite exclusionary and cruel.  Children need to hear clearly from us, "It's not all right to treat other people this way.  How do you think she feels being told she can't play with you?”  Kids don't have to play with everyone or even like everyone, but they can't be cruel about excluding others.
小学低年级，小孩们就会拉帮结派，形成自己的小团体，但是这样的做法是非常排外的，而且对别的同学也很残忍。这种情况下，我们应该明确地告诉他们：“你这样对待其他同学是不对的，你觉得你同学得知自己不能和你玩会是什么感受？”当然小孩不需要和每一个玩在一起，也没必要喜欢每一个，但是他们不应该残忍地去孤立其他的小孩。

Boys who are physically small or weak are more prone to victimization.  Making fun, picking on and other forms of bullying need to be identified in their earliest stages.  The message needs to be crystal clear.  “This is not okay.  Think about how he must feel.  How could you include him and let other kids know it’s not all right to treat others this way?”
身体瘦小的男孩更容易受到伤害。孩子们应该很早就明白欺凌的各种形式，比如“取消”，“捉弄”。 “这种做法是不对的，想想被孤立的小孩是什么感受。你如何接纳他，并且让其他小孩知道上面对待其他小孩的方式是存在问题的。”这一信息必须非常明确地传达给孩子们。
Children who are not bullies or target of bullying have a powerful role to play in shaping the behavior of other children.  The most powerful way to stop bullying is to teach every child to speak up on behalf of children being bullied.  Speaking up and saying, "Don't treat her that way, it's not nice." or "Hitting is not a good way to solve problems, let's find a teacher and talk about what happened." Can stop bullying in its tracks!
从未欺凌过别人也从未被欺凌过的小孩在改变其他小孩行为的过程中可以发挥巨大的作用。阻止欺凌最有效的方式就是教导每一个小孩站出来为被欺凌的小孩发声。他们可以站出来并且说道：“不要那样对她，这样一点都不友善。”或者是“打人不是解决问题的好办法，我们去找老师看看到底发生了什么。”这样完全可以遏制欺凌的蔓延。
While the Take A Stand Program methodically introduces concepts and skills that are age appropriate and can be used daily as children learn to address interpersonal conflict more effectively, adult intervention and guidance is a necessary part stopping bullying.    
但是“欺凌预防项目”循序渐进地向不同年龄段的儿童介绍适合他们的观点和传授他们技能，而且此项目可以每日安排学习。儿童学会如何更加有效地解决人际矛盾时，成人干预和引导也是阻止欺凌必要的一部分。

RP Role-Play
角色扮演

Children learn by doing.  Role-play is what makes prevention of bullying and interpersonal conflict real for children.  There is a fundamental difference between a “concept” and a “skill.”  This is important for parents and schools to understand because stories, videotapes, coloring books, etc. only teach concepts.  
让小孩们寓学于行是角色扮演的目的。角色扮演旨在让儿童亲身投入到预防欺凌和人际冲突的活动中。“认知”和“能力”还是存在本质区别的。重要的是，父母和学校需要认识到这一点，因为故事，视频和绘画书等其他形式都只是让孩子们有这个“认知”。

Role-playing is what takes concepts and turns them into skills.  Actually walking through situations and having the children practice different responses is what takes the information from the level of a concept – or an idea – to a skill that is learned in the “muscles” and will never be forgotten.  
通过角色扮演，认知转化为技能。实际上，带着孩子们体验不同的场景，让孩子们练习不同的回应，目的在于把“认知”或“想法”层面的信息转换成一种技能。而这种技能是孩子们调用全身肌肉学习获得的技能，掌握之后是永远不会忘记的。
It is like the difference between understanding how to ride a bicycle and actually being able to ride a bicycle.  Role-play, merged with discussion and activities, enables children to learn the skills in their muscles.  This is what allows them to actually intervene on behalf of themselves or others in real life situations.  
这其实就和知道如何骑自行车和会骑自行车存在区别一样的道理。角色扮演中有各种讨论和活动。这一环节下来，孩子们可以通过肌肉记忆掌握这些技能。当他们在现实生活中碰到这类场景，他们会自然而然出面进行干预和阻止。
The process of teaching role-playing is one of discussion first and then actually walking through a scenario, applying the concepts to real situations and learning how to implement the concepts with skill.  This is usually a process of successive approximations based on your coaching.  
在展开角色扮演时，首先是围绕一个话题展开讨论，然后再设定一个场景，让孩子们在真实场景中运用掌握的观念，并且学会如何运用技能落实这些观念。其实，这就是在您的指导下，带领孩子们逐次逼近，最终实现目标的一个过程。
Most children begin a role-play not being able to implement the very thing they were just talking about.  As you act out a situation, you want to coach children to communicate effectively, utilizing eye contact, clear and straightforward language and consistent body language.  Each time they role-play, children improve and feel more comfortable taking action.  This comfort level – advance preparation for life – is what will enable them to use the skills in their peer group and community.  

大多数孩子刚开始在角色扮演过程中并不能很好地落实讨论中提到的某件事情。当您设定一个场景时，您希望指导孩子们进行有效地沟通，包括使用眼神交流，使用简明扼要的语言，肢体语言要配套等等。每一次角色扮演之后，孩子们都会取得进步，表演时也会更加自然。而这是为孩子们日后的生活做好准备，可以帮助他们在日后的同龄人群体中或社区中运用这些技能。
Most people are uneasy about role-play in the beginning.  But it is really what we do every day.  We walk through how to handle a business meeting or a conflict with a family member.  We think through how to handle getting the baby and the dog and the groceries into the house.  The difference in the classroom is that we act out solutions rather than just thinking about them.  
大多数人最刚开始参与角色扮演都放不太开。但其实角色扮演的场景就是我们每天都会遇到的场景。我们会模拟如何与家人进行谈事或者解决冲突。我们还是思考如何让婴儿，宠物狗以及各种杂物在家庭中如何和谐融为一体。但是在教室里面我们不仅仅是停留在思考的层面上，我们会进一步去思考解决方式。

Victims vs Targets
受害者vs 被欺凌目标

I do not refer to children who are the target of bullying behaviors as victims because they do not have to be.  When a child is targeted for bullying, s/he can stand up, ask for help or choose to ignore the bully.  Children who are targets of bullying can also learn new skills and move on.  Victim implies permanent damage.  While this can be true for children who are long-term targets or who experience trauma from bullying, we do not want to paint every child who experiences bullying with that brush.
我不会把那些成为欺凌目标的儿童称为受害者，因为他们可以避免成为受害者。如果一个小孩成为欺凌的目标，这个小孩可以站出来寻求帮助，当然她/他也可以选择忍气吞声，当做什么没发生过。那些成为欺凌对象的小孩也可以学习新的技能并且继续向前进。“受害者”这一词语意味着永久的伤害。但是这对某些长期遭受欺凌或者饱受欺凌所带来的痛苦的那些小孩，永久性伤害是真实存在的。我们不愿意让每一个遭受过欺凌的小孩都带有“受害者”的标签。

 Intervention with Children who are bullying
如何引导欺凌他人的小孩

Children who engage in bullying behaviors need to be dealt with consistently and effectively.  Bullying should not be overlooked or excused.  We know bullying behavior only escalates as children get older and the ramifications for bullies and the group as a whole are significant.  
我们需要有效地对欺凌他人的小孩进行引导，直到他们停止这种行为。欺凌不应该被忽视或者原谅。
DO NOT BLAME.  Do not get into a discussion about the "whys" of what happened.  Your discussion with a bullying child should focus on several key points:
不要任意指责。不要追究事情发生的动机。您与欺凌他人的孩子对话时，应该着重在以下几点：
Bullying is not acceptable in our school, family or in society.
欺凌在学校，家庭和社会都是不允许的。
If you are feeling frustrated or angry or aggressive, here are some things you can do. Then provide concrete examples based on the current situation.
如果你感到很沮丧，愤怒或者想挑衅他人，你可以通过其他方式来发泄情绪。然后您可以根据具体情况提供具体的范例。

Role-play or act out the new behaviors so your teaching is experiential.  Remember that role-play is the key to changing behavior!
进行角色扮演或者向这位小孩演示正确的行为，这样您的教学才有经验可据。记住角色扮演时改变小孩行为的关键步骤！

Ask, how can I help you with this?  Who could you go to in school if you see yourself getting into this type of situation again?

询问小孩我该如何帮助你？告诉他如果他下次再遇到这种情况在学校该去找谁？

Specify concretely the consequences if the aggression or bullying continue.

明确告诉小孩如果他/她继续欺凌别人，会导致怎样的后果。

Your objective is to stop the behavior, understand the child's feelings, then teach and reward more appropriate behavior.
您的目的是阻止小孩的欺凌行为，理解小孩的感受，然后告诉他/她更加合适的行为，并且如果这位小孩能够做到的话，予以他/她奖励。
