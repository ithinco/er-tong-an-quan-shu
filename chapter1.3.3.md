### 为自己大声说话

### 七岁到九岁儿童

### 第三天课程

#### 目标

教育孩子们如何运用“我会告诉大人”来有效地做出反应。

练习坚定地应对“我会告诉大人”的不同回应，如：

* 我不在乎
* 没人会相信你
* 收买
* 绝交
* 特殊朋友
* 你会有麻烦
* 威胁你

教育孩子们，如果他们没有得到帮助，就要不停地说。

让孩子认识到有时候“告诉大人”会很难，尤其是涉及到自己爱的人时。

#### 大人须知

“我会告诉大人”是让孩子们自行摆脱困境或避免虐待的第二步。大多数犯罪分子想要孩子的“貌似”配合，而且希望孩子保密。拒绝参与或不保持沉默的孩子遭受虐待的几率要小很多。

人们普遍认为，“我会告诉大人”原则不会增加孩子遭受虐待的风险。记住，施虐者寻找的是温暖、不作评判、亲切的关系。他们不想要拒绝。如果遭到了拒绝，他们更可能转而寻求另一个目标，而不是冒险伤害一个懂得抗拒的孩子。

告诉大人应该像条件反射一样。孩子们应该有这样一种感觉，即他们总是能把发生在自己身上的事情告诉信任的人，而且总是能得到倾听和信任。这一条件反射的形成依赖于之前的经验和不断的强化。我们每次倾听时，都要告诉他们，他们的感受和问题很重要，我们总是会严肃对待。需要重点说明的是，大人们不能告诉孩子们可以信任或不信任谁。任何人都可能成为施虐者。孩子需要自行判断信任或不信任谁。

最后，孩子们需要知道，大人也有自己的问题和烦恼，他们也不总是能很好地倾听，有时候也提供不了帮助。如果出现这种情况，孩子们需要知道去找别人。他们需要传达的主要信息是：必须不停地说，直到有人帮助他们。

记住，角色扮演重在实践，以便让孩子们学会技能，而不仅仅是概念。

#### 孩子须知

在你要求别人停止正在对你做的事情时，他们总是会听吗？让我们看看当视频里的孩子们对大人说“不”时，会发生什么事。

#### 和孩子一起看视频

如果你要求某人停止触碰你，而他们不停止，我想要你说：“我会告诉大人”。这是不是告密呢？

不。告密说的是你报告和自己一样大的孩子的事情，这样他们就有麻烦了。

#### 角色扮演

RP:   What if you're at a friend's house and the big brother wants you to sit really close to him while you're watching television? You've told him you're uncomfortable and you want to sit on the floor, but he keeps bothering you.  What would you say and do?

You want to create an absolutely clear progress here for children. First they say "no," including appropriate body language. Then they say "I'm going to tell.”  Then they tell.

What if he says to you, "Don't you like me? If you liked me you'd sit here with me."  What would you  say and do?
**角色扮演**：假如你在朋友家看电视，朋友的哥哥想要和你靠得很近，你告诉他，你觉得这样很不舒服，但他依然这么做，你会怎么说，怎么做？

在这里，你需要让孩子对事情的进展有清楚的认识。首先孩子要说“不”，包括合适的肢体语言。然后他们说：“我会告诉大人”，然后就告诉大人。

假如他对你说：“你不喜欢我？如果你喜欢我，我们就坐在一起。”你会怎么说，怎么做？

RP:   What if you were taking gymnastics and the man who teaches the class always tickles your face with his mustache?  You ask him to stop but he keeps doing it. What would you say and do?
What if when you say "I'm going to tell," he says, "Go ahead and tell, I don't care."  What would you say and do?  Do you think your mom or dad or teacher would care? Sure they would.

RP:   What if a close friend of your mom or dad's is taking care of you and every time she gets close to you she sticks her hand up your shirt? You ask her to stop, but she keeps doing it. What would you say and do?

What if when you say "I'm going to tell," she says, "Oh, I'm sorry, I won't do it again, but please don't tell." What would you say and do?

Your child should say, "I'll still tell."

What if she says, "Please don't tell and I'll buy you whatever you want."  Would that be okay?


RP:   What if the dad of one of your friends comes into the bathroom with you whenever you go to visit?  You ask him to stop but he does it again. What do you say and do?

What if you say, "I'm going to tell" and he says, "When you’re in my house you do things my way. If you don't like it, you’ll have to find another friend." What would you do?
RP:   What if your babysitter gives you an extra special good night hug and kiss and asks you to keep it a secret?  What should you do?
Hugs and kisses should never have to be a secret. If someone asks you to keep hugs or kisses a secret, tell right away.
Would it be hard to tell?
Would you tell anyway?
RP:   What if someone said to you, “If you tell, I’ll hurt you or someone in your family?
This is a threat and you should never try to take care of something like this by yourself. No matter how scared you are, you need to tell a grownup who can help you. If the first person you tell doesn't help, keep telling until someone does help you.
Would it be scary if someone said something like that to you? 
What would you do?   That's right, you'd tell someone.
What if the person you told said something like, "Oh, they don't mean any harm."  Then what would you do?
That's right, you'd tell someone else!
