### 为自己大声说话

### 七岁到九岁儿童

### 第三天课程

#### 目标

教育孩子们如何运用“我会告诉大人”来有效地做出反应。

练习坚定地应对“我会告诉大人”的不同回应，如：

* 我不在乎
* 没人会相信你
* 收买
* 绝交
* 特殊朋友
* 你会有麻烦
* 威胁你

教育孩子们，如果他们没有得到帮助，就要不停地说。

让孩子认识到有时候“告诉大人”会很难，尤其是涉及到自己爱的人时。

#### 大人须知

“我会告诉大人”是让孩子们自行摆脱困境或避免虐待的第二步。拒绝参与或不保持沉默的孩子遭受虐待的几率要小很多。

由于 85% 到 90% 的施虐者都是孩子认识的人，因此在预防虐待上，教育孩子们抵抗要挟和不保密就变得很重要了。在受到要挟时拒绝沉默和拒绝保密的孩子更有可能免于虐待。犯罪分子希望孩子的配合，通常只有孩子保证保密时，他们才会继续下去。

人们普遍认为，“我会告诉大人”原则不会增加孩子遭受虐待的风险。记住，施虐者寻找的是温暖、不作评判、亲切的关系。他们不想要拒绝。如果遭到了拒绝，他们更可能转而寻求另一个目标，而不是冒险伤害一个懂得抗拒的孩子。

在所有情况下，孩子们都必须知道，无论什么时候他们觉得必须说“我会告诉大人”的时候，他们都可以告诉父母或自己信任的人，从而让其他人停止触碰他们。

记住，角色扮演重在实践，以便让孩子们学会技能，而不仅仅是概念。
"I'm going to tell" is the second step for children to extricate themselves from a difficult situation and to avoid sexual abuse. Most perpetrators want the seeming "cooperation" of the child. They also require secrecy. Children who refuse to participate, or to keep quiet about what is happening to them, are less likely to be victimized.

It is believed that "I'm going to tell" does not increase the risk of violence to the child. Abusers who are known to the child are not usually motivated by violence. They are looking for a warm, nonjudgmental, affectionate relationship. They don't want or need rejection. It's easier for them to find another child than to risk discovery by hurting a child who refuses to go along.

Saying, "I'm going to tell," and then telling should be like a reflex. This reflex is instilled through previous experience and constant reinforcement. Each time we listen, we teach children that their feelings and questions are welcome and will be taken seriously. It is also essential that we not tell children specifically who they can or cannot trust. An abuser can be anyone. Children need to make their own decisions about     who they trust.
告诉大人应该像条件反射一样。孩子们应该有这样一种感觉，即他们总是能把发生在自己身上的事情告诉信任的人，而且总是能得到倾听和信任。这一条件反射的形成依赖于之前的经验和不断的强化。我们每次倾听时，都要告诉他们，他们的感受和问题很重要，我们总是会严肃对待。

Finally, children need to understand that adults have their own problems and worries, that they don't always listen well and that sometimes they can't help. When this happens, children need to know who else to go to. The primary message is: keep telling until someone listens and helps you with your problems.
孩子们并不总是能有效地沟通，大人们也不总是能很好地倾听，但孩子们需要知道，他们必须不停地说，直到有人帮助他们。

#### 孩子须知

在你要求别人停止正在对你做的事情时，他们总是会听吗？让我们看看当视频里的孩子们对大人说“不”时，会发生什么事。

#### 和孩子一起看视频

如果你要求某人停止触碰你，而他们不停止，我想要你说：“我会告诉大人”。这是不是告密呢？

不。告密说的是你报告和自己一样大的孩子的事情，这样他们就有麻烦了。

#### 角色扮演

RP:   What if you're at a friend's house and the big brother wants you to sit really close to him while you're watching television? You've told him you're uncomfortable and you want to sit on the floor, but he keeps bothering you.  What would you say and do?

You want to create an absolutely clear progress here for children. First they say "no," including appropriate body language. Then they say "I'm going to tell.”  Then they tell.

What if he says to you, "Don't you like me? If you liked me you'd sit here with me."  What would you  say and do?
RP:   What if you were taking gymnastics and the man who teaches the class always tickles your face with his mustache?  You ask him to stop but he keeps doing it. What would you say and do?
What if when you say "I'm going to tell," he says, "Go ahead and tell, I don't care."  What would you say and do?  Do you think your mom or dad or teacher would care? Sure they would.

RP:   What if a close friend of your mom or dad's is taking care of you and every time she gets close to you she sticks her hand up your shirt? You ask her to stop, but she keeps doing it. What would you say and do?

What if when you say "I'm going to tell," she says, "Oh, I'm sorry, I won't do it again, but please don't tell." What would you say and do?

Your child should say, "I'll still tell."

What if she says, "Please don't tell and I'll buy you whatever you want."  Would that be okay?


RP:   What if the dad of one of your friends comes into the bathroom with you whenever you go to visit?  You ask him to stop but he does it again. What do you say and do?

What if you say, "I'm going to tell" and he says, "When you’re in my house you do things my way. If you don't like it, you’ll have to find another friend." What would you do?
RP:   What if your babysitter gives you an extra special good night hug and kiss and asks you to keep it a secret?  What should you do?
Hugs and kisses should never have to be a secret. If someone asks you to keep hugs or kisses a secret, tell right away.
Would it be hard to tell?
Would you tell anyway?
RP:   What if someone said to you, “If you tell, I’ll hurt you or someone in your family?
This is a threat and you should never try to take care of something like this by yourself. No matter how scared you are, you need to tell a grownup who can help you. If the first person you tell doesn't help, keep telling until someone does help you.
Would it be scary if someone said something like that to you? 
What would you do?   That's right, you'd tell someone.
What if the person you told said something like, "Oh, they don't mean any harm."  Then what would you do?
That's right, you'd tell someone else!
