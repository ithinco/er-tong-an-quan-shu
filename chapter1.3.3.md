#### 大人须知

“我会告诉大人”是让孩子们自行摆脱困境或避免虐待的第二步。拒绝参与或不保持沉默的孩子遭受虐待的几率要小很多。

由于 85% 到 90% 的施虐者都是孩子认识的人，因此在预防虐待上，教育孩子们抵抗要挟和不保密就变得很重要了。在受到要挟时拒绝沉默和拒绝保密的孩子更有可能免于虐待。犯罪分子希望孩子的配合，通常只有孩子保证保密时，他们才会继续下去。

人们普遍认为，“我会告诉大人”原则不会增加孩子遭受虐待的风险。记住，施虐者寻找的是温暖、不作评判、亲切的关系。他们不想要拒绝。如果遭到了拒绝，他们更可能转而寻求另一个目标，而不是冒险伤害一个懂得抗拒的孩子。

在所有情况下，孩子们都必须知道，无论什么时候他们觉得必须说“我会告诉大人”的时候，他们都可以告诉父母或自己信任的人，从而让其他人停止触碰他们。

记住，角色扮演重在实践，以便让孩子们学会技能，而不仅仅是概念。
"I'm going to tell" is the second step for children to extricate themselves from a difficult situation and to avoid sexual abuse. Most perpetrators want the seeming "cooperation" of the child. They also require secrecy. Children who refuse to participate, or to keep quiet about what is happening to them, are less likely to be victimized.

It is believed that "I'm going to tell" does not increase the risk of violence to the child. Abusers who are known to the child are not usually motivated by violence. They are looking for a warm, nonjudgmental, affectionate relationship. They don't want or need rejection. It's easier for them to find another child than to risk discovery by hurting a child who refuses to go along.

Saying, "I'm going to tell," and then telling should be like a reflex. This reflex is instilled through previous experience and constant reinforcement. Each time we listen, we teach children that their feelings and questions are welcome and will be taken seriously. It is also essential that we not tell children specifically who they can or cannot trust. An abuser can be anyone. Children need to make their own decisions about     who they trust.

Finally, children need to understand that adults have their own problems and worries, that they don't always listen well and that sometimes they can't help. When this happens, children need to know who else to go to. The primary message is: keep telling until someone listens and helps you with your problems.

#### 孩子须知

在你要求别人停止正在对你做的事情时，他们总是会听吗？让我们看看当视频里的孩子们对大人说“不”时，会发生什么事。

#### 和孩子一起看视频

Okay, if you ask someone to stop touching you and stop, then I want you to say, "I'm  going to tell."

Is that being a tattletale?    No. Being a tattletale (or tattling) is when you tell o the same age as you so you can get them in trouble

#### 角色扮演

All these boys and girls learned that it can sometimes be hard to say "no," especially to people you like. You don’t hurt their feelings and, at the same time, you need to speak up for yourself.

RP:  What if your sitter always wants you to sit really close to you when you're watching tv or playing a video game?  You've told him that you want to sit by yourself, but he keeps pulling you over.  What do you say and do?

What if the sitter says to you, "Don't you like me? What would you say and  do?

RP:   What if a friend of your mom or dad's takes you to the movies and puts his arm around you on the back of the chair?   When you tell him it is making you uncomfortable, he says, "Oh, you're my special friend.   Don't you like me? If you liked me, you'd show me." What would you say and do?

Move over and say "no"   clearly.  Then tell me about what happened when you come home.

RP:   What if you’re visiting a friend whose big sister want to “play doctor”? She tells you and your friend to take off all your clothes so she can examine you?   What do you say and do?

Say "no" using words, eye contact and body language (step back).   Then go tell an adult or call  me to come and get you.

RP:   What if the swimming teacher is putting sunscreen on your back? You feel uncomfortable and ask him to stop, he says "Oh, it's all right.   I'm just trying to protect you.  What would you say and do?

 RP:   What if the big brother of one of your friends is wrestling with you. He is touching you all over and makes you feel really uncomfortable? When you ask him to stop, he says he's "teaching you how big kids play." What would you say and do?

Say "no" with words and body language, and go back to play with your friend or go home.  Would you also tell me when you get home?

RP:   What if a grownup you know tries to kiss you on the lips and you don't like it?   What would you say and do?

What if when you ask them to stop, they say, "It's all right, this is just my way of showing you how much I love you."

If it's not okay with you, is it okay for the grownup to do that?

#### 没有秘密原则

你们是不是要守很多规矩？告诉我，家里有什么规矩。

今天我要告诉你们一条新规矩，这条规矩叫做“没有秘密”原则。

“没有秘密”原则的意思是，我们不会再有秘密了！如果有人要你保密，你要说：“不，我会告诉大人。”

惊喜没问题！惊喜很快就会说出来，而且惊喜通常都会让人高兴。

你在生日或节日时会得到惊喜吗？

记住，如果有人要你保守秘密，你要说：“我会告诉大人。我不保密。”

RP:   What if your sitter wants you to take a bath with her and tells you not to say anything to anyone?
Is that a secret or a surprise? It's a secret, and you should say "no."

RP:  What if a neighbor wants you to come over to the house to see her new game room, but she tells you that you can't tell anyone about it?  Is that a secret or a surprise?

It's a secret and you should say "no."  Plus, do you go to anyone's house without asking your me first? 

RP:   What if your dad's boss comes to visit and gives you money but tells you not to tell your dad? What would you say and do?

Say "no" and tell me.

RP:   What if I say I'll give you a new video game if you keep it a secret?  What about new sneakers, a new bike, or a new pet?  Is there anything I could give you to get you to keep a secret?

If someone tries to get you to keep a secret by offer you special treats, are you going to tell?

RP:   What if the babysitter breaks something real and tries to get you to keep it a secret?  What if the babysitter says she'll tell your mom or dad it if you don't keep the secret? What do you do? 

If someone is touching you, you ask them to stop, and the person says "don't you like me," or "I'm teaching you about being grownup," tell them to stop.  You decide for yourself what touch is okay and not okay with you.
