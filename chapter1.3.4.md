We've talked about taking care of yourself and speaking up for yourself whenever someone touches you in a y that is not okay with you. But there are other ways that people kids feel bad.

What if someone says to you, "You're stupid," does that hurt?

What about if they say to you, "You can't do anything right," or, "You're a bad kid," does that hurt?

This directly contradicts the old saying, “Sticks and stones may hurt my bones, but names will never hurt me.”  It just isn’t true.  Words hurt and we need to give our children a way to deal with things that are said to them.
 
If someone hurts you with their words and it happens a lot, you should tell someone about that. Who would you tell?

Have your child list resources and write them down on the board or paper.

What if someone hurts your body, like hitting you too hard, because they say you were bad?   Would you tell someone?

Do you think your mom or dad have problems?

Most children know their parents have problems and have no reluctance about saying so.

Do mom or dad ever treat you differently because of their problems?  Do they get cranky or mean?

Does that mean you did anything wrong?

RP:  What if the big sister of one of your friends is always mean to you when you go over to her house.  She pinches you so hard she leaves bruises.  Show me how you would tell me what is happening so I can help? 
Actually go through the process of getting your attention and telling.

RP:  What if your dad always comes home from work in a bad mood.  He jumps on your for every little thing.  You know he is having a hard time at work, but you also want to talk to someone about it.  What would you do?
Once again, go through the entire process.

RP:  What if your uncle yells at you when you are visiting.  Who would you tell?

What if you told me and I was not really paying attention?

What if I didn’t think it was anything serious and I said, “Oh, he is just that way, ignore him.”

If someone hurts you or makes you feel badly about yourself because they are having a bad day, always tell someone!
There are lots of people who can help you if you have a problem.  If grownups take their problems our on you, you have to tell and get help!
