### 与陌生人有关的一切

### 七岁到九岁儿童

### 第一天课程

#### 目标

让孩子清楚地知道什么是陌生人，在多种情况下该遵循哪些原则。

建立当孩子独处时，孩子能且必须为自己负责的观念。

复习当孩子独处时，应该遵循的四大基本原则：

* 与陌生人保持一米远。
* 不和陌生人谈话。
* 不要陌生人给的任何东西，就算是自己的东西也不要。
* 不和陌生人去任何地方。

复习如何以及去哪里获得帮助。

增强儿童的能动感，减少对陌生人的害怕和焦虑。

#### 大人须知

NOTE:  There is a lot of material in the 3 sessions for this age group.  Feel free to introduce it over a number of days.  Follow your child’s lead in terms of interest and understanding of how to apply the rules.

Children are quite aware of strangers, and are concerned about what they might do. They are eager to learn how to take care of themselves and are ready to have their questions and concerns answered.

Missing children have become a part of daily life. While statistics are inconsistent and no hard numbers yet exist that really define the magnitude of the problem, we know that some children are abducted and abused by strangers. Their pictures appear all around us. Children look at pictures of the missing and, quite naturally, wonder if it could happen to them. Unanswered, these questions can significantly undermine a child's ability to grow up feeling confident and secure.

Our intention in this program is to shift the emphasis from the negative to the positive, focusing on the child’s ability to learn and use specific safety skills.

### 传统方法

过去，我们告诉孩子，陌生人有好坏之分，孩子要警惕坏人。我们告诉孩子们要留意坏人，坏人通常会给他们糖果，让他们帮忙找丢失的狗狗等等。

孩子以为理解了我们的意思，就专心留意坏人。这只会让孩子们更容易陷入危险境地，被一个举止“和善”的人引诱进一个看似无害的场景中。

对陌生人的普遍误解还存在着另一个同样重大的隐患。孩子会害怕，他们的生活也蒙上了一层恐惧的阴影。当我们这么对孩子们说：“不要上陌生人的车，他们可能会把你带走，让我们再也看不到你。”我们在孩子们的脑海里植入了一个可怕的可能性场景。我们让他们感觉渺小、脆弱，夺走了孩子们在成长的过程中感觉安全和关心的能力。

### 儿童安全课的方法

The Safe Child approach to teaching children to prevent abuse by strangers is a two-part process that addresses how children think and how they act.  It requires preparing them to actually protect themselves while, at the same time, developing and enhancing their perception of their own well-being.

Children need to know who strangers really are. They need accurate information and specific guidelines that will limit their vulnerability, while maintaining their ability to move about freely, without fear or anxiety, in their everyday lives.

This program is designed to allow you to address both the real and imagined issues for children. It highlights and clarifies the typical misunderstandings children have about strangers - misunderstandings which increase their risk - as it teaches new techniques for safety. It strengthens and focuses the child's sense of competency and control. It teaches children to think about the decisions they make, to act quickly and consistently in specific situations, to recognize when they need help and where to get it.

儿童安全课程的设计理念是，为儿童提供陌生人教育，但不向他们灌输“世界充满想要伤害他们的坏人”这种理念。儿童学习自救的愿望十分强烈。这也是自然的成长过程之一。诚然，和儿童在一起时，成年人要对他们负责，但当儿童独处或是和朋友在一起时，他们能够也必须对自己的安全负责。儿童安全课可以帮助孩子实现这一目标。

吓唬不管用。吓唬只会让孩子胆怯、麻木，而不能保护孩子，使他们安心。举个例子，你警告孩子：“不能要陌生人给的糖，糖里可能有毒。”这是一种可怕却无效的做法，因为孩子不理解这句话的真正含义。结果，孩子不是因为觉得“一个好人不可能对我下毒”，要了陌生人的糖，就是反应过度，谁给的任何东西都不要。

我们教孩子如何在游泳和过马路时不害怕。我们不会为了保证孩子过马路时的安全，就给他们讲粗心司机撞死小孩的恐怖故事。相反，我们教育孩子基本的准则，以应对潜在的危险情况。儿童安全课采取的正是同一种理性的办法。

孩子们需要明白，陌生人不过是自己不认识的人，他们在生活中每天都会遇到陌生人。当儿童在没有成年人看护并遭遇陌生人时（如在外面或公园里玩耍时），儿童没必要害怕，但应当遵守必要的安全准则。遭遇陌生人时的安全概念和准则既简单又直白，成年人在进行教育时，切勿惊吓儿童或加入恐怖故事。儿童从3岁起就应开始使用这些准则，并且随着年龄的增长对准则做出调整。这些准则包括：

Children who have thought about their own safety with strangers, who understand what we want them to do, and who have practiced the techniques will be able to use the rules when they are needed -without anxiety. They will not only feel safer, they will safer!

#### 孩子须知

We're going to watch this video and then talk about strangers and some rules you should follow to help keep you safe.

什么是陌生人？

你能通过外貌来分辨好人坏人吗？

当你独自一人或和朋友在一起时，谁对你的安全负责？

你还记得第一条原则吗？

第一条原则是“与陌生人保持一米远”，我们也称它为“安全圈”。

演示：一米远是指成年人手臂的长度加上成年人弯腰后能够碰触到的距离再延伸一点点。另外也演示想象的“安全圈”。

RP:   What if someone comes into your yard and says, "Hi, I'm looking for the Smith house. Do you know where they live?" What would you say and do?
Stand up, back up so they are an arm’s length away.  Don’t talk to the person. 
RP:  What if a stranger came up to you and said, "Hi, you don't know me, but I just moved in across the street. What's your name?" What would you say and do?
Stand up, back up so they are an arm’s length away.  Don’t talk to the person. 
RP:  What if someone you don't know comes up to you and says "Hi, I have a little boy just your age. Would you like to come over and play with him some afternoon?"
Stand up, back up so they are an arm’s length away.  Don’t talk to the person.  Maybe come in and ask a parent to come out and meet the new neighbors.  
Do you remember Rule #2?
You don't talk to people you don't know when you yourself or with your friends.
Is that rude? Some people might think so. But, you’re old enough to make some decisions for yourself now.
What's more important, being polite or being safe
RP:  What if the person knows your name and maybe my name?  Does that matter?
No.  If you don't know the person, follow the rules.

RP:   What if someone comes into your yard and says, "Hi, I'm looking for the Guan house. Do you know where they live?" What would you say and do?

RP:  What if a stranger came up to you and said, "Hi, you don't know me, but I just moved in across the street. What's your name?" What would you say and do?

RP:  What if someone you don't know comes up to you and says "Hi, I have a little boy just your age. Would you like to come over and play with him some afternoon?"


Note:  The effectiveness of these rules for your child will depend on practice.  Feel free to play the “What if…” Game to assess their ability to actually apply the rules.
