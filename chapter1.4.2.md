### 十岁到十一岁儿童

### 第二天课程

#### 目标

让孩子练习抵抗常见的要挟，包括：
* 喜欢我/爱我
* 特殊朋友
* 绝交
* 收买
* 恐吓
* 威胁

继续加强沟通要素的练习，习惯说不。

继续鼓励和认识积极、健康的触碰行为。

建立并加强可以在一些情况下大声说出自己想法的意识。

通过角色扮演来练习大声说出自己的想法，并进一步发展沟通技能。

#### 大人须知

本课中的角色扮演游戏能让孩子们学会识别并抵抗常见的感情要挟，施虐者们经常用到这些把戏。由于 85% 到 90% 的施虐者都是孩子认识的人，而且孩子的貌似“配合”也是成功进行性侵的必要组成部分，因此直接拒绝参与是一个强大的预防工具。

在受到要挟时拒绝沉默和拒绝保密的孩子更有可能免于虐待。犯罪分子希望孩子的配合，通常只有孩子保证保密时，他们才会继续下去。

“我会告诉大人”是让孩子们自行摆脱困境或避免虐待的第二步。拒绝参与或不保持沉默的孩子遭受虐待的几率要小很多。记住，施虐者寻找的是温暖、不作评判、亲切的关系。他们不想要拒绝。如果遭到了拒绝，他们更可能转而寻求另一个目标，而不是冒险伤害一个懂得抗拒的孩子。

在所有情况下，孩子们都必须知道，无论什么时候他们觉得必须说“我会告诉大人”的时候，他们都可以告诉父母或自己信任的人，从而让其他人停止触碰他们。

记住，角色扮演重在实践，以便让孩子们学会技能，而不仅仅是概念。

#### 孩子须知

当你要求别人停下在做的事情时，人们并不总是会听。

让我们来看看，当孩子不想做某件事时，即便别人一直试图让他们做，他们会有多坚持己见。

#### 角色扮演

下面的角色扮演游戏中都有一些麻烦的问题，但每个孩子都找到了解决方法。让我们来亲自尝试，看看碰到类似问题时该怎么做。


Remember, if you ask someone to stop what they're doing and they don't stop, then I want you to say, "I'm going to tell."



RP: What if a friend of your mom or dad comes to visit and puts his arm around you in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable of that seems creepy?



When you try to move away he says, "Oh, you're friend, I came over just to see you." What would you say and do?



What if the person says to you, "Don't you like me? If you liked me, you'd sit here with me." What would you say and do?



We want to create an absolutely clear progression here for children.

First they say "no." Then they say, I’m going to tell." Then they tell.



RP: What if you were taking gymnastics and the man who teaches the class kisses your cheeks and gets too close to your face when he tells you how you did? You feel uncomfortable and intimidated. You ask him to stop and back up a little bit so you can see him better.



But he keeps doing it. When you say, "I'm going to tell," he says, "Go ahead and tell, I don’t care.” What would you do? Do you think your mom or dad or teachers would care?



RP: What if your best friend's dad touches your bottom or your legs every time you get close to him. You ask him to stop, but he keeps doing it. What would you say and do?



What if when you say, "I'm going to tell," he says, Oh, I’m sorry, I won't do it again, but please don't tell." What would you say and do?



What if he says, "Please don't tell and I'll do special for you. Okay?" Would that be all right?



What is that called? That's called bribery.



RP: What if your sitter pinches and bends your ear every time you do something she doesn't like? You tell her it hurts, but she keeps doing it.



When you say, "I'm going to tell," she says, "Go ahead and tell, no one will believe you. I'm the sitter and I'm in charge." What would you do?



What's that called?



The word for that is intimidation. She's trying to control you without admitting what she's trying to do. Does she have the right to do that?



RP: What if someone says to you, "If you tell, I'll hurt you or someone in your family."



What's that called?



That is a threat and you should never try to handle a situation like that by yourself.



Would it be scary if someone said something like that to you?



No matter how scared you are, you need to tell and keep telling until someone helps you.



RP: What if you tell someone about what happened and they say something like, "Oh don't be silly. They were just joking."



Then what would you do? That's right you'd tell someone else.



Review



When you say, "I'm going to tell," there are lots of ways people might try to get you to do what they want you to do.



They might try bribery saying, "Go ahead and tell, I don’t care."



They might tell you that "No one will believe you,” or use intimidation and threats.



All of these are ways to try to control you. Are you going to let that happen? NO!



Is it being responsible to tell?



Is telling making a choice that is healthy and good for you? Is it responsible to tell, to get help when you can’t handle something by yourself?



Does that mean it's going to be easy? Probably not, but it’s important to remember that the person who is bothering you probably won’t stop until you do tell someone.
