### 做自己最好的朋友

### 十岁到十一岁儿童

### 第一天课程

#### 目标

让孩子分清哪些触碰行为可以接受，哪些不可接受。

允许孩子在一些情况下说“不”，比如有人以孩子不喜欢、感觉不舒服或认为不对的方式触碰时。

通过角色扮演游戏，教育孩子们以适当的方式有效地说“不”。

强化有效沟通三要素的概念：
* 眼神接触
* 言辞达意
* 相配的肢体语言

认识到每个孩子对于触碰行为都有自己的想法。

#### 大人须知

只要我们教，孩子们很快就会学会，自己能大声说出发生在自己身体上的事情，我们还应该言传身教，让他们知道自己的身体的确属于自己。 小孩子已经知道自己喜欢和不喜欢哪种触碰。他们通过社会交往，对触碰已经有了大概的期望。他们知道哪种触碰不对或让自己感觉不舒服。预防性虐待训练建立在这些元素上，让孩子可以有效、适当地表达自己的感觉。

在本课中，所有例子都不构成性虐待。然而，如果孩子学会了对他人捏自己脸蛋或举起自己的行为说“不”，他们也就能对其他自己不喜欢的触碰行为说“不”了。

预防发生在虐待开始前，发生在感觉不舒服最开始的那一刻，发生在犯罪分子试图测试孩子是否会配合时。In an article entitled "What Sexual Offenders Tell Us About Strategies" researchers Conte, Wolf and Smith asked offenders, “After you had identified a potential victim, what did you do to engage the child?" The following responses from these offenders eloquently portray the efficacy of The Safe child approach to prevention:


"I would initiate different kinds of contact, such as touching the child’s head. Testing the child to see how much she would take before she would pull away."

"Getting comfortable with the child... Making them feel comfortable with me...like a hug, start touching their arms, legs, hugging them."

简而言之，这类在大多数情况下对于孩子来说都可接受的触碰，成了孩子大声说出来的首个机会，而这时距离虐待的发生还有很久。


This is also why it is important to keep our own judgements of good and bad out of the role-plays and discussion. A hug may be wonderful or awful depending on the relationship and the intentions of the person involved. Prevention happens at the level of the child with his/her own interpretation of what is happening. Children who have been told, for example, that all hugs are good will not trust their own feelings and will be hampered in their efforts to say "no" when they feel uncomfortable.

We also need to change our messages about obeying people in authority. These children are old enough to exercise some judgement about the appropriateness of adult requests. Because we cannot -- and should not -- always be available to help children make important choices, they need to have the ability to make those choices for themselves and to know they will be supported when they do. Going through the specific role-plays will give you a sense of whether the children in your group know the difference between blindly doing what they're told and saying "no" when they need to.
