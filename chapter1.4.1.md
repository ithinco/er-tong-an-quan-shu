#### 目标

让孩子分清哪些触碰行为可以接受，哪些不可接受。

允许孩子在一些情况下说“不”，比如有人以孩子不喜欢、感觉不舒服或认为不对的方式触碰时。

通过角色扮演游戏，教育孩子们以适当的方式有效地说“不”。

强化有效沟通三要素的概念：
* 眼神接触
* 言辞达意
* 相配的肢体语言

认识到每个孩子对于触碰行为都有自己的想法。

#### 大人须知

只要我们教，孩子们很快就会学会，自己能大声说出发生在自己身体上的事情，我们还应该言传身教，让他们知道自己的身体的确属于自己。 小孩子已经知道自己喜欢和不喜欢哪种触碰。他们通过社会交往，对触碰已经有了大概的期望。他们知道哪种触碰不对或让自己感觉不舒服。预防性虐待训练建立在这些元素上，让孩子可以有效、适当地表达自己的感觉。

在本课中，所有例子都不构成性虐待。然而，如果孩子学会了对他人捏自己脸蛋或举起自己的行为说“不”，他们也就能对其他自己不喜欢的触碰行为说“不”了。

预防发生在虐待开始前，发生在感觉不舒服最开始的那一刻，发生在犯罪分子试图测试孩子是否会配合时。根据《性侵犯罪的策略》(What Sexual Offenders Tell Us About Strategies)这篇文章所述，性侵罪犯们在找到潜在的受害者后，可能会通过下列方式来接触孩子：

> “我会测试不同的接触方式，比如摸孩子的头。好知道孩子最多能接受什么程度的接触。”

> “让孩子适应和我呆在一起……让他们不会抵触我……比如拥抱，摸他们的胳膊、腿。”

简而言之，这类在大多数情况下对于孩子来说都可接受的触碰，成了孩子大声说出来的首个机会，而这时距离虐待的发生还有很久。

正因为如此，在角色扮演中保持对好坏的判断就非常重要了。拥抱可能很美好，也可能很糟糕，这取决于行动人和孩子的关系以及动机。孩子对正在发生的事情有自己的解读，预防就发生在这一阶段。如果教育孩子说，所有拥抱都是好的，他们就不会信任自己的感觉，也就没那么容易在感觉不舒服时说“不”。

我们还需要改变要求孩子服从权威的说法。这些孩子的年纪已经够大，足以判断大人所提的要求是否合适。因为我们无法也不应该总是帮孩子作出重大决策，孩子们需要具备自行作出这些决策的能力，并且知道在有需要时，我们总会支持他们。通过下面的角色扮演游戏，你将知道孩子们是否明白盲目服从和在必要时说“不”的区别。

记住，角色扮演重在实践，以便让孩子们学会技能，而不仅仅是概念。

The central message underlying all the role-plays is this:There isn't anyone in the entire world that children can't say "no" to if they are asked to do something they think:is wrong,that could hurt them, orthat they know they shouldn't do.

#### 孩子须知

Have you ever found that it can be difficult to speak up to adults or people that are older than you? We're going to watch some kids learning to speak up so they can communicate exactly what they want to say.

#### 角色扮演

If someone touches you in a way that makes you uneasy, is there anyone other than you who can take responsibility for communicating about it?

How would you define communication? Communication is when one person says something – with their body or their words -- and the other person understands what the person meant to communicate.

你还记得有效沟通的三大要素吗？

* 眼神接触
* 言辞达意
* 相配的肢体语言

What are some ways that people touch you that you don’t like?

How do you communicate that it's not okay with you?

DO you ever try avoiding the person, or stepping aside or just letting them go ahead and hug you rather than make a fuss? Let’s see what other options you have.

RP: What about if we have a big family get-together and someone comes up to you and touches your hair, pinches your cheeks, or kisses you and you don’t like it? How would you handle a situation like that?Role play several of these situations. Focus on clear verbal communication, consistent body language and eye contact. Be sure your child knows w/he has your permission to speak up, even with family.

RP: What if you have a coach who slaps you on the back every time he sees you? You don't like it and you feel a little weird and embarrassed about all the attention he gives you. What would you do?Actually role-play and practice a response.

RP: What if a friend of your dad's always sits right next to you when he comes to visit and puts his hand on your leg? He seems nice enough, but you feel uncomfortable. You're worried about being rude since he's your dad's friend. What would you do?

If you do things like avoiding the person, or making excuses like you have to go do your homework, could the problem keep coming up? So, is that an effective way to handle the problem?

Are there some kinds of touch you like with some people and not with others?

That's part of individual differences and should be encouraged.

RP: What about touch that seemed okay at first and then changes so it doesn't seem okay anymore? Use an example your child brings up or an example like hugging to long, being too close, rubbing arm or leg or kissing.

Would you feel able about speaking up? What would you do?

What if you do say something and the person doesn’t stop or doesn't respect what you said, or tries to talk you into letting them do what they want to do? What would you do next?

The best thing to say is, "I'm going to tell." That lets the person know you are serious, and you're prepared to get help from another adult if your wishes aren't respected.

Would that be embarrassing or feel like tattling?

Tattling is when they tell on someone so they can get them in trouble. While speaking up and letting the person now they're going to tell may be embarrassing, it' no more difficult than the feelings they'll have if they let the touching continue.

RP: What if an adult friend of yours is putting suntan lotion on you at the pool? After a minute you feel uncomfortable about the way the person is touching you. What do you say and do?

What if the person says something like, "Oh it's ok, we’re special friends." Is it okay?

What if you say "I'm going to tell" and your friend says, "If you tell, I won't be your friend anymore." What would you do?

If someone says they won't be your friend anymore, is that person really your friend?

I don't think so. It's important that you tell someone as soon as you can about what happened.

Your body is part of who you are. People who care about you, and respect you, should also respect your body. When you speak up, they should listen.

If anyone touches you in a way that you don't like, that makes you feel funny inside, or that you think is wrong, what are you going to do?

SPEAK UP and TELL SOMEONE!
