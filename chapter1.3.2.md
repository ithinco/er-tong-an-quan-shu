### 你的身体属于你自己

### 七岁到九岁儿童

### 第二天课程

#### 目标

让孩子练习抵抗常见要挟，包括：

* 喜欢我/爱我
* 特殊朋友
* 绝交
* 收买

继续加强沟通要素的练习，习惯对成人说不。

继续鼓励和认识积极、健康的触碰行为。

清楚地区分秘密和惊喜。

通过角色扮演践行“没有秘密”原则，尤其是在触碰行为上。

#### 大人须知

The role-plays in this lesson prepare children to recognize and resist the common emotional ploys used by offenders to get them to go along in abusive situations. Since the vast majority of abusers (85-90%) are known to the child, and seeming "compliance" on the part of the child is necessary for the successful completion of the offense, straightforward refusal to participate is a powerful prevention tool.

Resisting emotional coercion and requests for secrecy are also an essential part of the prevention of abuse. Children who do not acquiesce when pressured emotionally, and who refuse to keep secrets, stand a better chance of resisting abuse because the offender wants the child's participation, and often will not move ahead without some assurance that s/he will not be revealed.

“没有秘密”原则也是儿童保护的重要组成部分，这一年龄段的孩子们应该掌握这一原则。要知道，犯罪分子肯定会要孩子们保守秘密，让他们不说出发生在自己身上的事情。对所有保密要求都自动回应“不，我会告诉大人”的孩子，就没那么容易受到伤害。

惊喜和秘密不同。惊喜很快就会说出来，而且惊喜让人高兴。父母们应该了解这一点。在日常生活中加强这一教育时，大人应该记住这一区别，用自己的话向孩子解释。比如，为母亲节准备的项目就是惊喜，而不是秘密。孩子们知道如果将这件事说了出去，就破坏了惊喜。

#### 孩子须知

Do people always listen when you ask them to stop what they're doing?  Let’s see what happens when the kids in the videotape say "no" to a grownup.

#### 和孩子一起看视频

#### 角色扮演

All these boys and girls learned that it can sometimes be hard to say "no," especially to people you like. You don’t hurt their feelings and, at the same time, you need to speak up for yourself.

RP:  What if your sitter always wants you to sit really close to you when you're watching tv or playing a video game?  You've told him that you want to sit by yourself, but he keeps pulling you over.  What do you say and do?

What if the sitter says to you, "Don't you like me? What would you say and  do?

RP:   What if a friend of your mom or dad's takes you to the movies and puts his arm around you on the back of the chair?   When you tell him it is making you uncomfortable, he says, "Oh, you're my special friend.   Don't you like me? If you liked me, you'd show me." What would you say and do?

Move over and say "no"   clearly.  Then tell me about what happened when you come home.

RP:   What if you’re visiting a friend whose big sister want to “play doctor”? She tells you and your friend to take off all your clothes so she can examine you?   What do you say and do?

Say "no" using words, eye contact and body language (step back).   Then go tell an adult or call  me to come and get you.

RP:   What if the swimming teacher is putting sunscreen on your back? You feel uncomfortable and ask him to stop, he says "Oh, it's all right.   I'm just trying to protect you.  What would you say and do?

 RP:   What if the big brother of one of your friends is wrestling with you. He is touching you all over and makes you feel really uncomfortable? When you ask him to stop, he says he's "teaching you how big kids play." What would you say and do?

Say "no" with words and body language, and go back to play with your friend or go home.  Would you also tell me when you get home?

RP:   What if a grownup you know tries to kiss you on the lips and you don't like it?   What would you say and do?

What if when you ask them to stop, they say, "It's all right, this is just my way of showing you how much I love you."

If it's not okay with you, is it okay for the grownup to do that?

#### 没有秘密原则

你们是不是要守很多规矩？告诉我，家里有什么规矩。

今天我要告诉你们一条新规矩，这条规矩叫做“没有秘密”原则。

“没有秘密”原则的意思是，我们不会再有秘密了！如果有人要你保密，你要说：“不，我会告诉大人。”

惊喜没问题！惊喜很快就会说出来，而且惊喜通常都会让人高兴。

你在生日或节日时会得到惊喜吗？

记住，如果有人要你保守秘密，你要说：“我会告诉大人。我不保密。”

**角色扮演**：假如爷爷/外公带了礼物给你，但只有你保守秘密，才把礼物给你。这是秘密还是惊喜？这是惊喜，而且你也不会说，因为这会破坏惊喜。

**角色扮演**：假如你的保姆想要你晚点睡，还让你吃蛋糕和冰激淋，但她告诉你必须保密，你会怎么办？这是秘密还是惊喜？你会怎么说，会怎么做？这是秘密，你应该说“不”。

**角色扮演**：假如隔壁邻居想要你去他家玩游戏，但你不能告诉任何人这件事。这是秘密还是惊喜？你会怎么说，会怎么做？这是秘密，你应该说“不”。另外，在去任何人的家里之前，你都应该问我。

**角色扮演**：假如照顾你的人说要给你特别的晚安抱和亲亲，并要求你保密，你会怎么办？你会怎么说，会怎么做？你应该说“不”，然后告诉我发生了什么事。拥抱和亲亲永远也不应该是秘密。如果有人要求你为拥抱或亲亲保密，立刻告诉我。
