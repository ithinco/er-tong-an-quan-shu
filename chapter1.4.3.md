### 第三天课程

#### 目标

理解暗暗的沟通不会有效果

探讨撒谎的后果

探讨孩子可以以及无法自行处理的情况范围

思考在一些情况下不遵守承诺的可能性

#### 大人须知

孩子通常会试图让身边的大人注意到自己碰到了问题。他们会暗暗地告诉大人发生在自己身上的事情，希望大人能明白。孩子们需要明白，这样根本行不通。他们必须亲自去寻求自己需要的帮助。

还有些时候，孩子们会为自己根本没做的事而受到责备。在这种情况下，孩子们要为自己说话会尤其困难。通过角色扮演游戏和讨论挑战权威需要什么，孩子们就收获了宝贵的技能。

最后，有时候这一年龄段的孩子会告诉朋友自己遭受了虐待，但要求朋友承诺不说出去。孩子们需要知道，他们可以也有责任告诉自己信任的大人发生了什么事。而且孩子们也应该知道，别人告诉他们这件事是想寻求帮助，在这种情况下，真正的朋友就应该告诉能提供帮助的大人。

#### 孩子须知

当很难告诉大人某个问题时，一些孩子会做出行动，让父母注意到并询问，比如哭泣、表现得无精打采或发怒。让我们看看视频里的孩子们是怎么做的。

#### 和孩子一起看视频

#### 角色扮演

Have you ever done anything like that?

RP: What if something really upsetting happened at school? When you come home, you storm into the house, throw your books on the table, run up to your room and slam the door? Would I know what is wrong?

What if later that evening you come to the dinner table with a long face, refusing to talk or eat? Would I know what is wrong?

What if I thought you were just being moody and sent you from the table back to your room? Would that make things better or worse?

What choice do you need to make? What would be the responsible thing to do?

Do you think we would want to know what you are upset about, even if it is something hard to talk about or embarrassing?

RP: What if you were faced with a situation where you said one thing and an adult said another, do you think I would believe you or the adult?

RP: What if your best friend told you a secret and you promised not to tell, but the secret was about something that had happened to your friend and you knew your friend needed help?

Would you be breaking your promise of secrecy if you tell an adult about the problem?

What are your choices? What would be the responsible thing to do?

Would you be afraid your friend might get angry with you for telling the secret? Maybe telling you is the only way your friend can ask for help.

Who are some people that you could tell in order to get help for your friend?

No Questions Asked

In my family we have a No Questions Asked Rule.

This means that our son can call us anytime, anywhere and ask to be picked up. We agree to do so, no questions asked! On the way home, we can discuss what happened and agree how to handle it, but he knows that he will not be in trouble for having made a smart choice to get out of a bad situation.

I talked about this with him, and all of his friends who had the same offer from me, for many years never thinking I would get the call. But I did get the call, multiple times, from him and from his friends.

This rule can save your child’s life and is an excellent way to end this series of lessons.

Even though this series of discussions is over, these skills are important in every single day of your child’s life. Keep talking about how you child can be more effective and more capable in managing his/her life.
