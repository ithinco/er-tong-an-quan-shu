#### 身体欺凌

How many of you think the grown-ups you live with have problems? (Most kids know adults have problems and have no reluctance about saying so.)

有多少人认为自己身边的大人存在问题？（大多数小孩知道他们的父母存在问题，也不排斥说出这一点。）

Do adults ever treat you differently because of their problems?

大人是否因为他们个人的问题对你的态度发生变化？

What are some of the ways you know the grown-ups around you are under stress? No names or specifics.

你通过哪些途径知道周围的大人压力很大？

How many of you have ever been punished?

你们有多少人被父母惩罚过？

Did you ever feel that the punishment was unfair? (Most kids have this experience.)

你是否觉得很不公平？（大多数小孩都有这种经历）

What if someone punishes you in a way that injures your body?

如果有人惩罚你，导致你身体受伤？

What if that punishment is something like hitting you so hard that it leaves bruises or marks that are there the next day?

如果对你的惩罚，比如狠狠地打了你，导致你第二天身上还有痕迹或者淤青？

What if they say they only did it because you were bad?

如果他们这样做仅仅是因为觉得你表现不好？

Would you tell someone?

你会把这件事告诉别人吗？

Would you be afraid to tell?

你会害怕告诉别人吗？

You need to know that no child ever deserves to be punished in a way that leaves marks or bruises that are there the next day. An adult who does that is having problems that are being taken out on the child. When you ask for help for yourself, often the grownup can also get help with their problems.

你需要明白，第二天身上还有淤青或者痕迹的惩罚绝对不能发生。如果大人这样做，说明他们自己存在问题，并把问题发泄在孩子身上。如果你自己寻求帮助，大人们经常也会得到帮助，解决他们自己的问题。

Telling someone else about what is happening to you is important so you don’t continue to get hurt and the adult can get help for their problem.

把发生的一切告诉他人非常重要，因为只有这样，你才不会继续受到伤害，大人的问题也可以得到解决。

Would it take a lot of courage to ask for help in a situation like this? Absolutely.

在这样的处境中，寻求帮助需不需要巨大的勇气？答案是必须的。

Is it important that you do it? Absolutely!

你这样做重不重要？绝对重要！

Emotional Bullying

情感欺凌

Do grown-ups ever hurt you with their words?

大人们是否对你说过伤人的话？



Just because an adult gets upset and says things that aren't very nice, that doesn't make what they say true.

但是仅仅因为他们自己心情不好，说出的一些不是很友好的话并不代表他们的真实想法。

RP I need someone to help me.

角色扮演：我需要一些人帮助我。老师会扮演例子中的成年人。



 (Teacher will play role of adult in all these examples.)



 If I say to you, "You're so stupid, I can’t believe you belong in my family." Does that hurt?

如果我对你说：“你太笨了，我难以相信我家竟然会有你这样一个孩子。”

你有没有很受伤害？

 Is it true just because I say it? Of course not!

我难道真是那个意思吗？当然不是！

 How does having someone say something like this feel in your body?

如果有人对你说这样的话，你身体感觉如何?

 What other feelings do you have?

你还有其他感觉吗？

 What response do you feel like making?

你想做出什么样的回应？

 This time, when I say something unkind to you, I want you to say, "That's not true about me" inside your head.



 "You're good for absolutely nothing!" Did you remember to say, “That’s not true about me?” How did it feel?

当你说些不友好的话时，我希望你可以学会说：“我其实不是这样想的，这不是我的真实想法。”

RP What if an adult says to you, “You’ll never amount to anything!" Does that hurt?



 How do you handle it?

角色扮演：如果一个大人对你说:“你什么事情都做不成。”这句话让你感觉受伤吗？你又该如何处理呢？





RP What if an adult says, "You're the worst kid I’ve ever had to be around." Does that hurt?





 How do you handle it, so you don’t take it inside you or believe it?

角色扮演：如果一个大人对你说:“你是我见过最糟糕的小孩。”这句话让你感觉受伤吗？你又该如何处理呢？是置之不理还是相信他说的话？





Discussion: If someone hurts you with his or her words, and it happens to you a lot, you should tell someone about that. One important benefit of you asking for help is that the adult who is having a hard time can also get help with handling their problems. If you need to ask for help, who would you talk to? Make a list.

讨论：如果有人用言语伤害你，而且这种情况经常发生，你应该告诉某些人。如果你向他人求助，日子不舒服的那位大人也可以得到帮助，从而解决他自身的问题。如果有需要寻求帮助，你会告诉谁？列出一张名字清单。

Activity



1. Make a list of all the grown-ups that could help you with a problem. Write down their numbers and begin to develop your own phone book.

列出一张写有当你遇到问题时会向他/她求助的名字清单。写下他们的电话号码，开始制作自己的电话簿。
