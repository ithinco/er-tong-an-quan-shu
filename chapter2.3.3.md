### 七岁到九岁儿童

### 第三天课程

#### 目标
To learn the concepts of choice, agreements and consequences.
To apply these concepts to everyday life.
To understand the role of choice in day-to-day   events.
To establish that children must be responsible for themselves when they are themselves.

Introduction for adult
One of the things that increases risk for children of this age, is the emergence of feelings of invincibility -"it won't happen to me" - and the development of resistance to adult authority. This results in breaking the rules, often without regard for possible consequences. This conversation is designed to enable children to begin to take responsibility for the choices they make and to experience a higher level of individual freedom by establishing the relationship between choices and consequences.

Introduction for child
We're going to spend some time talking about how you take care of yourself and keep yourself safe by thinking about choices, agreements and consequences.

Role-play

Can you tell me, in your own words, what it means to make a choice?
Choice means to select with care, to select an after consideration.
What kinds of choices do you make every day? 
Can you tell me what an agreement is?
It is a spoken or unspoken understanding about how things will be done.
Another word for agreement is "rules." But are they really the same thing?
Do we use your ability to follow the rules – to keep your agreements - to decide what you get to do?
Talk about some examples.  If your child walks to school with friends, what agreements do you have?  How does your child let you know s/he can keep the agreements?  Talk about other examples that apply to your family.  
If you break the agreements you've made, what happens?  How would you define consequences?
Consequence means something that follows naturally as a result of your actions.
Is thinking part of making good choices?
Can you give me an example of a choice you've made without thinking and the consequences of that?
A good example is watching television before doing homework and then running out of time to finish an assignment.  
Making an agreement doesn’t mean you will automatically do it.  Each and every time we have to choose to keep our agreements, to break them, or to change them.
Is there anything wrong with changing agreements that don't seem to be working?
RP:  What if we want to drop you off at a store while we go shopping at another store nearby, but you feel scared and don't think you would be able to emergency, what would your choices be?

Actually role-play what your child would say to you.  If you say nothing and just stay scared, is that a choice?  Absolutely, it is.  
If you tell us how you feel and ask us to take you along with us, is that a choice?
RP:   What if we need to run out for a meeting and you are a little afraid to stay home alone.  Would you speak up?  Could you ask to go to a neighbor’s?  Could you ask to have someone come and stay with you?  Do these choices all have different consequences? 

Is there a limit to the number of choices there are in the world?  Probably the only limit is our ability to think of them.

But making choices is important because they give you more control in your life.

RP:   Role play other situations that are relevant to your child’s age and your family situation.  This is an especially good time to address something that has happened in the past or to prepare for an upcoming situation.
NOTE:  The Negotiating Privileges and Responsibilities chart is an invaluable way to plan for new privileges your child wants or a new responsibility you want your child to take on.  Negotiating Privileges and Responsibilities
Identify a privilege that you would like to have. Write it down. Then write down all of the responsibilities that go along with that privilege.
When you are finished, ask yourself, "Do I feel I can handle the responsibilities that come with the privilege I'd like to have?"
 If so, use this list to talk with your family about the privilege you would like to have. 
Negotiate with them a clear agreement (usually for a trial period). 
Remember, if you do not keep the agreements, the consequence is loss of the privilege. 
You are responsible for what happens as long as you and your parents are clear about and keep the agreement which is negotiated.
