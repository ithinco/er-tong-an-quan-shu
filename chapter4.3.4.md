有谁在霸凌他人的时候，自己主动停止霸凌行为的？

你有为自己的霸凌行为道歉吗？

对方接受了你的道歉吗？

你当时是什么感受？

你认为对方是什么感受？

**角色扮演**：从小组中选取一个欺凌他人然后道歉的例子，进行角色扮演游戏。

#### 情感霸凌

大人们是否对你说过伤人的话？

但是仅仅因为他们自己心情不好时说出的一些不好的话，并不意味着这是他们的真实想法。

如果有人对你说（大声说，让对方觉得好像你真这样认为）：“你个白痴，你竟然还认为自己很聪明。”你会觉得很受伤吗？

你身体的哪个部位觉得很难受？

What feelings do you have?

你都有哪些感觉？

What response do you feel like making?

你想做出什么回应？

Now I have an exercise that will help you learn not to take what people say inside, to not let people’s words hurt you.

现在，我有一个练习帮助你们不要把别人说的那些话往心里去，这样你就不会被那些话伤到。

NOTE: Choose a child with pretty good ego strength for this next exercise. Say the following and throw either nerf balls or pieces of paper as you say the words so they hit the child. Say these phrases like you mean it so the full impact is felt. As shocking as it is, the point of this exercise is to teach children not to internalize hurtful things that are said to them. This exercise makes real the adage “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me.”

注意：参加下一个练习的小孩自尊心要很强。你对这个孩子说下面的话语，同时，朝他身上扔玩具球或者几张纸。对小孩说这些词组时，你必须要让他感觉你真的是那样认为，只有这样小孩的感觉才最强烈。但是这个练习的目的是教会小孩不要把那些伤人的词语放在心里。这个练习很好的阐述了一句格言：“棍棒和石头或许会打断我的骨头，但是言语永远无法伤害我。”

STEP 1: (use a pretty secure child) I have three pieces of paper (or nerf balls). I want you to pretend that these are the words I am saying and to let them hit you.

步骤一：（选一个可靠的小孩完成这个练习）我手里有三张纸，也可以是三个玩具球。我希望你假装这些就是我要说的话并且让这几张纸或玩具球打到你。

“You are so stupid!” “You never do anything right!” “I hate you!”

“你太蠢了！”“你什么事情也不做对！”“我讨厌你！”

Was that pretty shocking? Was it hurtful?

是不是很震惊？有没有感觉很受伤？

Is it true about you? Of course not.

你真的是我说的那样吗？当然不是!

Who has the problem here, you or the adult? The adult does and she is taking her problem out on you.

这种情况下，谁才是有问题的那个？你还是那个大人？答案是那个大人，而且她还在你身上发泄。

There’s no reason for you to take that into yourself. So this time I want you to:

Step aside as you see the words and paper coming and

At the same time say “That’s not true about me” inside your head when I say the hurtful words.

你完全没有理由让自己受伤。所以，我希望你：

当你听到那些话和看到纸张朝你过来，靠边站

同时当我说那些伤人的话语，你自己要对你自己说：“我不是那样的。”

Step 2: Teacher: Again throw the papers or balls and say, “You’re an idiot?” “You never get anything right!” “I wish you belonged to someone else!”

步骤二：老师：再朝孩子扔一次纸张或者玩具球，并说到：“你是笨蛋吗?” “你什么事情也做不对！”“我真希望你不是我的孩子！”

How does that feel? How is it different?

你感觉怎样？和上次有什么不同？

Did the words hurt you that time?

这些话语伤到你了吗？

Note: If they did the child is still letting the hurtful words in, try having them say, “That’s not true about me,” out loud first and then silently.

注意：如果孩子还是觉得受伤，说明他们还是在意刚刚那些话语。你可以试着让他们说：“我不是这样的。”先是大声的说出这句话，然后保持沉默。

Step 3: Now, if someone was really angry, they wouldn’t want to see you stepping aside, so this time just see the words coming toward you and then taking a big detour around you. At the same time say to yourself “That’s not true about me.”

步骤3:现在，如果有人非常气愤，他们不想看见你躲开，这一次你看见这些话语直接朝你砸去，但最后绕开了你。同时，你一定要对自己说：“他说的不是对的，那不是我。”

 Teacher: This time just say the words without throwing anything. "You can't get anything right." "You're hopeless, you’ll never learn this." Did you let it in?

老师：这次不扔东西，只说那些伤人的词语。“你什么事情也做不对。”“你没救了，你永远也学不会这个。”听到这些话语，你感觉受伤吗？

So you really do have a choice about whether you let hurtful things people say into yourself or not. This same thing works with things kids say to you. You have a choice.

 所以，对于那些伤人的话语，你可以自己选择听进去还是当做没听见。同样，小孩对你说那些话时，你也可以当做没听见。

RP Note: Have a child who is particularly sensitive to what other kids say to him or her come up. You start saying things so the child can practice disregarding them. Then have 6 children line up and say things so the child can experience not caring what they say and not being aggravated by it. Do this with several children who need to learn this skill. This is particularly effective with bullies who believe they are set off by what people say to them. They too can learn to ignore other people’s taunts.

角色扮演：注意：抽选一个对别人说的话尤其敏感的小孩做这个练习。你先这个小孩说一些伤人的话语，这样孩子可以练习慢慢地不理会那些话。然后，你让6个小孩排成一队，逐个对这个小孩说那些话。这样，小孩可以学会不理会他们伤人的话语，也不会被激怒。需要掌握这个技能的小孩都要做这个练习。他们也可以学会忽略别人的嘲讽。

Adult Verbal Bullying

大人的言语欺凌

Everyone experiences unkind words from time to time and this skill is for knowing how to handle the occasional insult. For some kids, however, this happens all the time and it can be really hard not to take it in.

每个人有时候都会经历一些不友好的话语，这项技能可以帮助应对偶尔的冒犯。对一些小孩来说，他们一直都在承受一些伤人的话语，很难做到完全不理会。

If someone hurts you with his or her words, and it happens to you a lot, you should tell someone about that.

如果有人一直用言语伤害你，你应该找人倾诉。

If someone says unkind and hurtful things to you on a regular basis, they need to get some help with their problems. It’s not about you; it’s about the person saying the unkind things. Another adult needs to be the one to help the person who says the unkind things.

如果有人经常对你说不友善或者伤人的话语，这些人自己也需要别人帮助解决他们自己的问题。问题不在你身上，而是那位对你说不友善言语的人。他需要另一位大人帮助自己解决问题。

You need to keep telling yourself “That’s not true about me” and you need to get another adult to help.

你需要一直告诉自己“那不是真实的我”，而且你需要向另一位大人寻求帮助。

Physical Bullying

身体欺凌

How many of you think the grown-ups you live with have problems? (Most kids know adults have problems and have no reluctance about saying so.)

你们有多少人认为自己周围的大人存在问题？（大多数小孩知道他们的父母存在问题，也不排斥说出这一点。）

Do adults ever treat you differently because of their problems?

大人是否因为他们个人的问题对你的态度发生变化？

What are some of the ways that you know the grown-ups around you are under stress? No names or specifics.

你通过哪些途径知道周围的大人压力很大？（不记名讨论，也不必详细叙述）

How many of you have ever been punished?

你们有多少人被父母惩罚过？

Did you ever feel that the punishment was unfair? (Most kids have this experience.)

你是否觉得很不公平？（大多数小孩都有这种经历）

What if someone punishes you in a way that injures your body?

如果有人惩罚你，导致你身体受伤？

What if that punishment is something like hitting you so hard that it leaves bruises or marks that are there the next day?

如果对你的惩罚，比如狠狠地打了你，导致你第二天身上还有痕迹或者淤青？

What if they say they only did it because you were bad? Is that true?

如果他们这样做仅仅是因为觉得你表现不好？你真的是表现不好吗?

Would you want to tell someone?

你会把这件事告诉别人吗？

Would you be afraid to tell?

你会害怕告诉别人吗？

No child ever deserves to be punished in a way that leaves marks or bruises that are there the next day. An adult who does that is having problems that are being taken out on the child. They need to get some help with their problems just as kids get help with problems.

你需要明白，第二天身上还有淤青或者痕迹的惩罚绝对不能发生。如果大人这样做，说明他们自己存在问题，并把问题发泄在孩子身上。如果你自己寻求帮助，大人们经常也会得到帮助，解决他们自己的问题。



Telling another grownup about what is happening to you is important. They can help the adult that is hurting you to get help so they can deal with their problems in better ways.

你要把发生在你身上的事情告诉另一位大人，这一点非常重要。因为，这样可以帮助哪位伤害你的大人用更好的方式解决他们自己的问题。

Would it take a lot of courage to ask for help in a situation like this? Absolutely!

在这样的处境中，寻求帮助需不需要巨大的勇气？答案是必须的。

Is it important that you do it? Absolutely!

你这样做重不重要？绝对重要！

Next time we’re going to talk about how to tell so you really get help when you need it.

下一次，我们会讨论当你真的需要帮助时，你该如何去寻求帮助？
